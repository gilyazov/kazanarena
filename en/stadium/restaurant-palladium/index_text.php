<p>Just as you open the door of the Palladium restaurant you find yourself under a starry sky. You'll see an amazing panoramic view over the huge 45-thousand seated Kazan Arena stadium. All the restaurant is surrounded by stained-glass windows from which you can see what is happening at the stadium while enjoying your meal. </p>
<p>Restaurant is equipped with a unique VOID musical system, the only one in Kazan. Upon a request with the VOID system Palladium can easily be transformed into a nightclub. There is also a karaoke system with a wide choice of songs, and plasma panels that can translate any type of content: corporate presentations, memorable photos, videos, etc.</p>
